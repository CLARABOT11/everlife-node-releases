# Starting the Avatar

Now that your avatar is set up you can start it up using the command line / shell.

| Step                     | Linux/MacOS         | Windows                                  |
| ----                     | -----------         | -------                                  |
| 1. Start Avatar          | `$> ./run.sh avatar`| `C:\Users\John\elife_0.4.0> run avatar`  |

Note, that if you are running on Windows the command prompt Window will stay active. On Linux/MacOS the command will
return and the Avatar will continue to run in the background.
